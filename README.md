# Pulsar UI Theme Template

This is a **starter template** for creating a Pulsar UI theme.

This template only includes the **minimum of styling** needed and comes with a
neutral look. It could already be used as a real theme, but its purpose is to
serve as a basis for creating your own theme. It is documented throughout and
invites you to make changes to your liking. For some inspiration take a look at
other Pulsar themes at [pulsar-edit.dev](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/). Or <!--TODO: update to a theme URL if we get one-->
you're always free to fork a theme that already comes close to your vision.

Happy theming! ðŸš€

1. Fork this repository.
